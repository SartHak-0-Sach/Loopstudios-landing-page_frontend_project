## Overview

### The challenge

Explore the future of gaming with Loopstudios Landing Page! 

This webpage presents:-
- The optimal layout for the site depending on the user's device screen size ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. 
- Users can also interact with hover states for all elements on the page, enhancing engagement and providing a preview of interactive elements.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

Through this project I got to learn about applications of a variety of concepts as I had read about them but never tried them in an real time application until now as shown below in given code snippet-

```css
.container1 header nav ul li{
    list-style: none;
    display: inline-block;
    margin-right: 15px;
    position: relative;
}

.container1 header nav ul li:after{
    width: 0s;
    height: 2px;
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    bottom: -8px;
    background: #fff;
    transform: translateX(-50%);   
    transition: 1.5s;
}

.container1 header nav ul li:hover:after{
    width: 40%;
}
```
